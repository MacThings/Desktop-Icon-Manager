DIM is an macOS application that memorizes and restores icon positions regardless of the screen resolution. Multiple "arrangements" can be stored. It works for both the Desktop and Finder windows in Icon View. <br>

It also can toggle between showing and hiding Desktop icons- useful for privacy when others are viewing your screen(s).

DIM uses AppleScript (DIM/DIM.applescript) via AppleScriptObjC (DIM/DIMBridge.swift) to request various Finder actions.
